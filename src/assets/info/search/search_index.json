It involves simultaneously buying and selling futures contracts with different expiration dates. These two contracts are also known as the two legs of the spread. On Alpha5, this price difference or spread between individual futures contracts is available as a single contract, called Exchange Quoted Spread. The symbol for such a contract is denoted as follows: Symbol for Contract 1: Symbol for Contract 2 Eg:- Spread between Perpetual contract and December Futures will be given by BTCUSD:BTCZ19* * For a full list of all the month codes, refer to the section Month Codes for Futures. Why trade spreads Using spreads, a trader can speculate on the price relationship between the two contracts. Unlike outright futures contracts where profit is made with price movement in one direction, with spreads, a trader can profit from up to five different scenarios through the various relative price movements between the two underlying futures contracts. Spreads are also lower in volatility, being the price difference between two outrights. Lower volatility makes spread trading attractive to traders with lower risk appetites. Consequently, with risk minimized, larger positions become possible to initiate in spreads. Even in the case of a spread trade going against the trader, losses are limited in comparison to trades in outrights futures contracts. Thus, spread trading can be highly beneficial because: Lower Volatility Lower risk Limited Losses Increased opportunity for profit making Larger positions possible Points to consider trading spreads Spread trading is a good way to hedge directional risk and can be used a directional neutral trading strategy. By going long (buying) in one leg and short (selling) in other leg, a trader is protected against market moving in a particular direction. The two legs of a spread trade expire at different times, so a trader must be careful that expiry in one contract will convert the spread position into a naked outrights position. Thus, a trader needs to exit their spread position before this happens. Pricing and Representation The price of an Exchange Quoted Spread on Alpha5 is given by: Price of Contract_1 - Price of Contract_2 For example, let's say you want to calculate the price of BTCUSD:BTCZ19. Suppose BTCUSD is trading at $10000 and BTCZ19 is trading at $10400. Then, the price of BTCUSD:BTCZ19 = Price (BTCUSD) - Price (BTCZ19) = 10000 - 10200 = -400 Similarly, if BTCUSD is trading at $10000 and BTCZ19 at $9950, then price of the spread BTCUSD:BTCZ19 will be Price (BTCUSD) - Price (BTCZ19) = 10000 - 9700 = 300 If both BTCUSD and BTCZ19 are trading at $10000, then price of the spread BTCUSD:BTCZ19 will be Price (BTCUSD) - Price (BTCZ19) = 10000 - 10000 = 0 Thus, spread prices can be both negative , positive or zero . If the price is negative, it means the second contract is trading at a premium to the first contract. If positive, the second contract is trading at a discount. If the price is zero, it means both contracts are trading at par, i.e. at the same price. Margin Requirements Currently to trade an Exchange Quoted Spread on Alpha5, a trader needs to fulfil the margin requirements of the two individual contracts that make up the spread. So, Initial Margin for Spread = Initial Margin for Contract 1 + Initial Margin for Contract 2 = IM% * BTC Value of position in Contract 1 + IM% * BTC Value of position in Contract 2 Similarly, Maintenance Margin for Spread = Maintenance Margin for Contract 1 + Maintenance Margin for Contract 2 = MM% * BTC Value of position in Contract 1 + MM% * BTC Value of position in Contract 2 Let's consider an example : You want to take a 100000 position in BTCUSD:BTCZ19, while BTCUSD is trading at $10000 and BTCZ19 at $9975. For both contracts let IM = 5% and MM = 3% BTC Value of position in BTCUSD = 10000/100000 = 0.1 BTC BTC Value of position in BTCZ19 = 9975/100000 = 0.09975 BTC IM = 5% of 0.1 + 5% of 0.09975 = 0.0099875 BTC MM = 3% of 0.1 + 3% of 0.09975 = 0.0059925 BTC Trading the Spread Although on Alpha5, buying or selling an exchange quoted spread will be a single-click action, it is important understand what goes behind this action. When you buy (or long) the spread, it means you buy the first contract and sell the second contract. Consequently, to sell (or short) the spread, means you sell the first contract and buy the second contract. Suppose you want to trade the BTCUSD:BTCZ19 spread. When you buy this spread, it implies you bought the BTCUSD contract and sold the BTCZ19 contract. When you will sell this spread, you will be selling the BTCUSD contract and buying the BTCZ19 contract. NOTE: As a trader, you will not need to sell/buy the individual contracts of the spread, that will happen automatically based on you buying or selling the exchange quoted spread. At the time of expiry however, once one leg expires, the spread position automatically will become an outrights position in the non-expiring contract. Profit and Loss Calculation Profit and Loss calculation involves calculating the PnL of the individual contracts of the spread and then adding them together to find the net PnL. Lets take an example to understand this better: BTCUSD:BTCZ19 is trading at 25, with BTCUSD at $10000 and BTCZ19 at $9975. You buy 100000 contracts of this spread, and thus effectively, long (buy) 100000 of BTCUSD and short (sell) 100000 BTCZ19. After some time, BTCUSD:BTCZ19 is trading at 50, with BTCUSD at $10050 and BTCZ19 at $10000. Now for BTCUSD: Unrealised PnL = [1/Entry Price - 1/Market Price] * No. of Contracts = [1/10000 - 1/10050] * 100000 = 0.04975124 BTC For BTCZ19: Unrealised PnL = -[1/Entry Price - 1/Market Price] * No. of Contracts = -[1/9975 - 1/10000] * 100000 = -0.02506266 BTC Thus net unrealised PnL = 0.04975124 - 0.02506266 = 0.02468858 BTC Suppose the spread goes to 300, with BTCUSD at $10800 and BTCZ19 at $10500, and you decide to exit the position. Now for BTCUSD: Realised PnL = [1/Entry Price - 1/Exit Price] * No. of Contracts = [1/10000 - 1/10800] * 100000 = 0.74074074 BTC For BTCZ19: Realised PnL = -[1/Entry Price - 1/Exit Price] * No. of Contracts = -[1/9975 - 1/10500] * 100000 = -0.50125313 BTC Thus, net realised PnL = 0.74074074 - -0.50125313 = 0.23948761 BTC Contract Specifications Underlying Index Alpha5 BTC Index Symbol Contract_1 : Contract_2 Example BTCUSD:BTCZ19, BTCZ19:BTCH20 Contract Size 1 USD Instrument Type Difference of Inverse Futures Price Quotation US Dollars per 1 bitcoin Tick Size 0.5 USD P&L Settlement Cash Settled in BTC Contract Expiration Last Friday of the contract expiration month of the expiring contract at 08:00:00 UTC Position Limit 2,000,000 contracts. To increase limit contact us at info@Alpha5.com Fees See Fee Structure for complete breakdown as per profile Risks of Manual Spread Trading As of today, on any crypto derivatives exchange, manual buying/selling of individual contracts is required to trade this price difference also called a spread. There are several risks associated with the manual buying and selling of futures contracts to trade their spread. These are: Volatility Risk: There is a high chance of slippage while placing orders; you get fill in one contract and no fill/partial fill in the other Liquidity Risk: While exiting, you get fill in one contract but no fill in the other due to sparse order book High Fees: To minimise volatility risk, you have to place market orders to both enter & exit, so you pay the taker fees, four times Liquidation Risk: When you initiate a spread position, one contract will be in profit and the other in loss, so your position in the losing contract may get liquidated With Exchange Quoted Spreads, these risks are eliminated, as you trade the spread in a single click via the spread contract. Mark Price Mark Price for the spread is on the basis of the mark prices for the underlying contracts. Liquidation is done on basis of NAV. Example Below is a table tracking prices of BTCUSD, BTCZ19, the BTCUSD:BTCZ19 spread and the % premium/discount of futures to perpetual at different times: BTCUSD BTCZ19 BTCUSD:BTCZ19 Premium/Discount 10000 10200 -200 +2% 9800 10200 -400 +4.08% 10200 10200 0 0% 10700 10300 +400 -3.73% 10400 10200 +200 -1.92% 10000 9900 +100 -1% As evident, the different price movements of BTCUSD and BTCZ19 relative to one another give different trading opportunities. To reiterate, selling the spread means sell BTCUSD and buy BTCZ19. Buying the spread means buying BTCUSD and sell BTCZ19. Sell the spread at -200, Buy at -400, Sell at 0, if previously bought; if not Buy at 0 Sell at +400 Buy at +200 if previously sold; if not Sell at +200 Buy at +100 Note, that in this entire time, the spread trades between -3.73% to 4%, i.e. in a 7.73% range.","title":"Exchange Quoted Spreads"},{"location":"Exchange Quoted Spreads/#exchange-quoted-spreads","text":"","title":"Exchange Quoted Spreads"},{"location":"Exchange Quoted Spreads/#introduction","text":"Spread trading is simply trading the difference between the prices of two futures contracts.

A derivative is a financial contract between a buyer and seller whose value depends on an underlying asset, like Bitcoin. The name derivatives contract is used for these contracts, as their price is 'derived' from the price of the underlying asset. Q. What is the advantage of derivatives? A. Derivatives offer the advantages of protection against price volatility, the ability to hedge or speculate on the future prices of an asset (in this case cryptocurrencies) and better risk management. Q. What derivative contracts are available on Alpha5? A. Alpha5 offers three derivatives contracts: Perpetual Contract Quarterly Futures Contracts Exchange Quoted Spread Contracts Q. What are Futures? A. Futures contracts let traders go long or short on the future price of Bitcoin. These types of contracts need to be settled upon expiry; either in cash or by delivery of the underlying asset. Q. What are Perpetual Contracts? A.

What are Exchange Quoted Spreads? A. Spread trading involves simultaneously buying and selling futures contracts with different expiration dates. The name spread is given to the difference between the prices of the two futures contracts. Only on Alpha5, this price difference or spread between individual futures contracts is available as a single contract, called Exchange Quoted Spread. Q. Inverse futures and vanilla futures A. For Futures contracts, the currency in which price of the underlying asset (in this case a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) is denominated is called the quote currency. The base currency is the currency in which the PnL of a position in Futures is calculated. Depending on whether the base and quote currencies are same or different, there can be two flavours of Futures contracts, inverse Futures and vanilla Futures. For an inverse Futures Contract, the quote currency is different from the base currency. If the quote currency is same as base currency, it is known as a vanilla Futures Contract. Alpha5 offers inverse Futures Contracts where base currency is BTC and quote currency is USD. Q. How is spread trading beneficial? A. Benefits of Spreads: Lower Volatility Lower risk Limited Losses Increased opportunity for profit making Larger positions possible Q. Is options trading available on Alpha5? A. As of now, options are not offered on Alpha5, but will soon become available. Q. What is funding? A. For perpetual contracts, a mechanism called funding is employed to keep the price tethered to the underlying spot price. Funding involves exchange of payments at fixed intervals between buyers and sellers based on a funding rate. Q. What is Mark Price? A. Mark Price is the price used in the calculation of Unrealised PnL and expiration price. Q. What is bid/ask? A. The bid is the price that buyers are willing to pay for a trading asset. The ask is the price that sellers are willing to take for a trading asset. Q. Profit and Loss Calculation A. Profit and Loss is calculated on the basis of entry and exit/market prices. For unrealised PnL: [1/Entry Price - 1/Market Price]*No. of Contracts = Profit/Loss in BTC For realised PnL: [1/Entry Price - 1/Exit Price]*No. of Contracts = Profit/Loss in BTC Example You buy 10000 contracts at Entry Price = $5000 If market price is $8000 then: Unrealised PnL = [1/5000-1/8000]*10000 = 0.75 BTC If you exit when market price is $10000, then: Realised PnL = [1/5000-1/10000]*10000 = 1 BTC","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"FAQ/#exchange-operation","text":"Q.

Three types of derivatives products are available for trading: Perpetual Contract Quarterly Futures Contracts Exchange Quoted Spread Contracts General information regarding margin , prices, index and exchange functioning are provided below. You can navigate directly to a topic from the menu. Alpha5 BTC Index To calculate the Alpha5 BTC Index Price, the latest prices from 5 different crypto exchanges namely Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, Itbit,and Kraken are sourced continuously. The mid-price is calculated using the best bid and best ask prices, from each of the 5 exchanges. The exchanges with the highest and the lowest prices are excluded from further calculation. The remaining 3 exchanges then given equal weightage of 33.33% each to calculate the BTC index price. In the case one or more exchange's price feed is unavailable or exchange(s) are disabled, prices from 2 out of 4 or 1 out of 3 exchanges, excluding the exchanges with highest and lowest price, will be used to calculate the Alpha5 BTC Index. If only 2 active price feeds are available, both will contribute an equal 50% weight to the Index. If only a single price feed is available, this price will be the index price. If for some reason Alpha5 could not get the price feed from any of these exchange, trading will be temporarily disabled ( platform locked ) until a connection is re-established with any one of the exchanges. Mark Price For Perpetual Contracts, the Mark Price is dependent on the underlying Index Price and the Funding rate. For Futures Contracts Mark Price is the average of Best Bid Price and Best Ask Price. If there are no bids or no offer or both bids and offers are missing then BTC index price will be the Mark Price of the Futures contract. Funding For perpetual contracts, a mechanism called funding is employed to keep the price tethered to the underlying spot price, which will be the Alpha5 Index Price. After a fixed interval of 8 hours, there is an exchange of payments based on the value and sign of the funding rate. The funding rate is calculated over this fixed interval over the course of 24 hours, every 8 hours. Thus, funding happens at 0 UTC, 8 UTC and 16 UTC in a 24 hours cycle. Only traders holding a position at these times will either pay or receive funding. The funding a trader has to pay/will receive is calculated as: Funding = Position Value * Funding Rate . If the rate is positive, longs (buyers) will pay the shorts (sellers). If the rate is negative, the shorts pay the longs. Funding is a net-zero operation for the exchange; it is payments being exchanged between buyers and sellers. Expiration Price The expiration price is used for the settlement of expiring futures contracts. A time-weighted average of the Alpha5 BTC Index from 07:30 UTC till 8:00 UTC, on a per minute basis, is used for its calculation. Thus, expiration price is given as the average of 30 instances of the Alpha5 BTC Index, in the last half hour before settlement occurs. Initial Margin and Maintenance Margin Initial Margin(IM) is the minimum account balance required to initiate a position. IM = Order Value * IM Percentage Maintenance Margin(MM) is the minimum account balance required to keep a position open. MM = Position Value * MM Percentage Initial Margin and Maintenance margin will be calculated for all orders and trades. Initial Margin will be blocked for all open positions and open orders ( except the orders that will reduce the position size ). Profit and Loss Profit and Loss is calculated on the basis of entry and exit/market prices. There are two types of profit/loss (PnL), realised and unrealised. Realised PnL This includes profits and/or losses from closed positions, trading fees and funding fees. Unrealised PnL This is PnL for open positions. Unrealised PnL is calculated on the basis of mark price. Unrealised PnL can be negative or positive immediately after an order executes. This happens when the mark price is different from the last price. Do note, unrealised profits are always added in real time to the NAV. Average Entry Price The average entry price for a position is given by the total number of contracts in the position divided by the value (in BTC) of the total position entered. FIFO in PnL and Average Entry Price Calculation Entering and exiting positions on Alpha5 happens as per the 'First-In, First-Out' (FIFO) principle, with PnL and average entry price calculations reflecting the same. FIFO implies that contracts in positions entered first are also the contracts that are sold/bought first when a position is being exit. The example below illustrates this further: Suppose you enter a long position (buy) of 1000 contracts in BTCUSD at $6000 You enter another long position of 1000 contracts in BTCUSD at $5000 and another long position of 1000 contracts when BTCUSD price is $7000 Now, Total Position (in BTC) = 1000/6000 + 1000/5000 + 1000/7000 = 0.50952381 BTC Total Contracts = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000 Average Entry Price = Total Contracts/ Total Position (in BTC) = 3000/0.50952381 = $5887.85 Now suppose, after some days the Mark Price for BTCUSD is $9050 You unrealised PnL will be calculated as follows Unrealised PnL = [1/Entry Price for 1st position - 1/ Mark Price]* Contracts in Position 1 + [1/Entry Price for 2nd position - 1/ Mark Price]* Contracts in Position 2 + [1/Entry Price for 3rd position - 1/ Mark Price]* Contracts in Position 3 = [1/6000 - 1/9050] * 1000 + [1/5000 - 1/9050] * 1000 + [1/7000 - 1/9050] * 1000 = 0.53409629 BTC Now, suppose you exit at $9000 by selling half your total position, i.e. 1500 contracts, then as per FIFO, the contracts in the position that was taken first will be exit first, followed by contracts in the second position and so on. Hence, your Realised PnL will be calculated as follows Realised PnL = [1/Entry Price for 1st position - 1/ Exit Price]* Sold Contracts in Position 1 + [1/Entry Price for 2nd position - 1/ Mark Price]* Sold Contracts in Position 2 = [1/6000 - 1/9000] * 1000 + [1/5000 - 1/9000] * 500 = 0.1 BTC Consequently, your average entry price will be calculated as follows Now, Total Position (in BTC) = 500/5000 + 1000/7000 = 0.24285714 BTC Total Contracts = 500 + 1000 = 1500 Therefore, after the first exit, you have Average Entry Price = Total Contracts/ Total Position (in BTC) = 1500/0.24285714 = $6176.47 NAV and Available Balance There are two types of account balances, Net Asset Value (NAV) and Available Balance. NAV will be used for Liquidation Process and Available Balance will be used to check order placement. Available Balance = NAV \u2013 IM Blocked For example, a user deposit 1 BTC to his account. NAV = 1 BTC Available Balance = 1 BTC Say the trader places an order of value 2 BTC, then for IM = 5% IM = 5% of 2 BTC = 0.1 BTC Say fees charged is 0.075%, then Fee = 0.075% of 2 BTC = 0.00150 BTC Updated NAV = 1 - Fee = 1-0.00150 = 0.99850 BTC Available Balance = NAV \u2013 IM Blocked = 0.99850 - 0.1 = 0.899850 BTC While placing a new order, if IM > Available Balance , order will be rejected. Margin Call As soon as NAV<=IM, a margin call will be issued to the trader via email. The trader can then choose to keep their positions open by increasing their account balance, and/or cancelling some or all open orders and/or closing some or all positions. Auto Liquidation If the Alpha5 Exchange Risk System assesses that a trader's account balance is insufficient to maintain the account's positions, it will trigger a liquidation event. The condition for the liquidation event is NAV <= MM . As soon as this condition is met, the Alpha5 Liquidation Engine will take over the trader's account. At this moment, all the open orders will be cancelled, and liquidation orders will be sent to market. During the liquidation event, a trader has no control over their account and cannot place, cancel or modify any orders from their account. This will continue till NAV > MM . A liquidation fee of 0.6% will be charged, that will go to the insurance fund. As soon as NAV<=IM, a margin call will be issued to the trader via email. The trader can then choose to keep their positions open by increasing their account balance, and/or cancelling some or all open orders and/or closing some or all positions. Liquidation can be avoided in the following ways: Set stop-loss when placing orders Cover position by adding funds to the account balance if a margin call is issued Close the position if a margin call is issued Cancel open orders to free up margin if a margin call is issued Alpha5 Risk Engine does not liquidate the entire position in one go, instead does so via consecutive liquidation orders that are of a minimum predefined size or a percentage of the total position. By breaking down the liquidation into multiple orders until NAV > MM, the engine tries to ensure the preservation of the account balance and thus the capital of the trader. Insurance Fund Alpha5\u2019s insurance fund covers the loss in case a trader goes bankrupt. The liquidation fee collected is added to this insurance fund. With the advanced Risk Management System of the Alpha5 Exchange and the margin requirements that have been set, it is very difficult to get bankrupt unless a very large market move occurs within a very short span of time. As the liquidation fees collected continues to replenish the insurance fund, any occurring bankruptcies will be covered for owing to the insurance fund. However, in the extraordinary circumstance that the insurance fund depletes completely, a mechanism of socializing the subsequent bankruptcies amongst winning traders will follow, although the exchange will try to ensure before such a scenario occurs, margin requirements are revised if a pattern of excessive bankruptcies is observed among the traders. Implied Logic In a futures market to trade perpetual, quarterly and exchange quoted spread contracts, a matching engine with implied order functionality is essential, as this maintains an interconnection between the three contracts. Any change in the liquidity and pricing of one of the contracts will automatically affect the liquidity and pricing of other contracts pertaining to the changed one. The mechanism of implied orders is such that whatever orders are outstanding in the spread market are actively pooled in the outrights market ( known as Implied Ins) and outstanding outrights orders are actively pooled in spreads ( known as Implied Outs ), so that a fill in the spreads is possible via outrights and vice versa. Implied logic ensures liquidity in spreads and outrights is interlinked which leads to better liquidity and prevents price manipulation that illiquid markets can be prone to.","title":"Home"},{"location":"General/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"General/#introduction","text":"Alpha5 is a crypto derivatives exchange offering a complete futures market for Bitcoin.

In the case one or more exchange's price feed is unavailable or exchange(s) are disabled, prices from 2 out of 4 or 1 out of 3 exchanges, excluding the exchanges with highest and lowest price, will be used to calculate the Alpha5 BTC Index. If only 2 active price feeds are available, both will contribute an equal 50% weight to the Index. If only a single price feed is available, this price will be the index price.

Only traders holding a position at these times will either pay or receive funding. The funding a trader has to pay/will receive is calculated as: Funding = Position Value * Funding Rate .

Example: Suppose you enter a long position (buy) of 1000 contracts in BTCUSD at $6000 You enter another long position of 1000 contracts in BTCUSD at $5000 and another long position of 1000 contracts when BTCUSD price is $7000 Now, Total Position (in BTC) = 1000/6000 + 1000/5000 + 1000/7000 = 0.50952381 BTC Total Contracts = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000 Average Entry Price = Total Contracts/ Total Position (in BTC) = 3000/0.50952381 = $5887.85 Now suppose, after some days the Mark Price for BTCUSD is $9050 You unrealised PnL will be calculated as follows Unrealised PnL = [1/Entry Price for 1st position - 1/ Mark Price]* Contracts in Position 1 + [1/Entry Price for 2nd position - 1/ Mark Price]* Contracts in Position 2 + [1/Entry Price for 3rd position - 1/ Mark Price]* Contracts in Position 3 = [1/6000 - 1/9050] * 1000 + [1/5000 - 1/9050] * 1000 + [1/7000 - 1/9050] * 1000 = 0.53409629 BTC Now, suppose you exit at $9000 by selling half your total position, i.e. 1500 contracts, then as per FIFO, the contracts in the position that was taken first will be exit first, followed by contracts in the second position and so on. Hence, your Realised PnL will be calculated as follows Realised PnL = [1/Entry Price for 1st position - 1/ Exit Price]* Sold Contracts in Position 1 + [1/Entry Price for 2nd position - 1/ Mark Price]* Sold Contracts in Position 2 = [1/6000 - 1/9000] * 1000 + [1/5000 - 1/9000] * 500 = 0.1 BTC","title":"Unrealised PnL"},{"location":"Margin Trading/#average-entry-price","text":"The average entry price for a position is given by the total number of contracts in the position divided by the value (in BTC) of the total position entered.

Limit These orders execute at a specific price \u2014 known as the limit price \u2014 or better. Buy limit orders can be executed only when a seller is willing to accept your limit price or lower. A sell limit order can be executed only when a buyer is willing to pay your limit price or higher. Stop or Stop-Market A stop order is an order which whenever the price reaches the trigger value you have specified \u2014 known as the stop price \u2014 it automatically becomes a market order. Traders who buy using a stop order usually do so to limit potential losses or protect a profit. A Buy stop order is always placed with a stop price above the current market price . Traders place a sell stop order to avoid further losses or to protect a profit that exists in case the market continues on a downward trend. The sell stop price is always set below the current market price . Stop-Limit This type of order combines the features of both a stop order and a limit order. When the stop price ( trigger value ) is reached, the stop order becomes a limit order rather than a market order. Trailing-Stop (coming soon) In these types of orders, the trader sets a Trail Price; if the markets regresses by a price equal to the Trail Price, a Market Order is triggered. A Trailing Buy Order has a positive Trail Price. A Trailing Sell Order has a negative Trail Price. Post-Only (coming soon) A post-only order is a limit order that is accepted if and only if it does not execute immediately, thereby ensuring it takes no liquidity from the order book. It executes as a maker order. Bracket (coming soon) These are three-component conditional orders. They comprise a main order (i.e. the buy or sell order), a stop-loss order and take-profit order. Since the main order is accompanied or bracketed by the other two orders, these are called brackets. Iceberg (coming soon) A large single order that has been automatically divided into smaller limit order so that the actual order quantity remains hidden is called an iceberg. Just like an iceberg, only the tip , i.e. a small portion of the order is visible on the market, while the bulk stays hidden. One-Cancels-Other (coming soon) One-cancels-other (OCO) is a conditional order, where depending on the execution of the first order, another order gets cancelled automatically.","title":"Order Types"},{"location":"Order Types/#market","text":"These are orders executed immediately at the current market price.","title":"Market"},{"location":"Order Types/#limit","text":"These orders execute at a specific price \u2014 known as the limit price \u2014 or better.

Funding For perpetual contracts, a mechanism called funding is employed to keep the price tethered to the underlying spot price, which will be the Alpha5 Index Price. After a fixed interval of 8 hours, there is an exchange of payments based on the value and sign of the funding rate. The funding rate is calculated over this fixed interval over the course of 24 hours, every 8 hours. Thus, funding happens at 0 UTC, 8 UTC and 16 UTC in a 24 hours cycle. Only traders holding a position at these times will either pay or receive funding. The funding to be paid/received is given by: Funding = Position Value * Funding Rate . For a positive rate, longs (buyers) pay the shorts (sellers). If the rate is negative, the shorts pay the longs. Funding is a net-zero operation for the exchange; it is payments being exchanged between buyers and sellers. Example Let Funding Rate be +0.01% at 8:00 UTC. Suppose a trader entered a position 10,000 long BTCUSD at 5:00 UTC, when BTCUSD was trading at $9800. At 8:00 UTC, suppose it is at $10,000 then Position Value will be 10,000 / 10,000 = 1 BTC Thus, Funding = 1 * 0.01% = 0.001 BTC Therefore, if the trader closes position at a price of say 10,200 at 14 UTC, before next funding happens, then, Realised Profit = (1/9,800 - 1/10,200) * 10,000 = 0.04001601 BTC Net Profit = Realised Profit - Funding Paid = 0.04001601 - 0.001 = 0.03901601 BTC Contract Specifications Underlying Index Alpha5 BTC Index Symbol BTCUSD Contract Size 1 USD Instrument Type Inverse Futures Initial Margin IM% Maintenance Margin MM% Price Quotation US Dollars per 1 bitcoin Tick Size 0.5 USD P&L Settlement Cash Settled in BTC Contract Expiration Non-expiring Position Limit 2,000,000 contracts.
